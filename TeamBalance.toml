# Team Balance Plugin Configuration
# Make sure to adjust these settings according to your server's needs.

[PluginSettings]
# The minimum number of players required on the server before the team balance
# feature activates. This prevents balancing when there are too few players.
# Default: 4
minimum_players = 4

# The maximum allowed ratio of scores between teams before triggering a balance.
# For example, if set to 1.6, the balance will trigger if one team's score is
# 60% higher than the other team's score. Adjust this value based on how strict
# you want the balancing to be.
# Default: 1.6
score_balance_ratio = 1.6

# Whether to use PerformanceScore for balancing.
# PerformanceScore is a custom metric that considers KDA (Kills, Deaths, Assists),
# damage dealt, and the in-game score to evaluate a player's overall performance.
# If set to true, the balance algorithm will use PerformanceScore to evaluate 
# players when balancing teams, rather than just the in-game score.
# Default: true
use_performance_score = true

# Maximum allowed difference in team sizes.
# This setting controls how much the team sizes are allowed to differ after balancing.
# If set to 1, the algorithm will attempt to ensure that the difference in the number 
# of players between the teams is no more than one. This helps prevent one team from
# having a significant numerical advantage over the other.
# Default: 1
max_team_size_difference = 1
